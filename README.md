## Object Detection and Tracking in Traffic Cameras Using Machine Learning

This project uses a traffic camera dataset to develop a model for object detection and tracking. The goal is to identify vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs to improve urban traffic management and predict congestion. It includes information on the application context, dataset used, evaluation metrics, and previous results. Perfect for exploring computer vision applications in mobility environments.
